The Ultimate Joker can be used for multiple purposes.  If a player is on the receiving end of draw card, the Joker 
can be used to reverse direction of play and cause the other player to draw the cards instead.  In the case of a

The Joker is also the only card that can block the <span>&Uuml;ber</span>.  It cannot be requested by a player
who has played a zero.
